# CoolGradient Data Engineering Assignment

This repository contains a hands-on dbt assignment for data engineering candidates. The assignment tests your ability to build a layered data warehouse architecture using modern data engineering patterns.

## What's Inside

This repo contains a **6-layer data architecture** that extends the medallion architecture:

- **0_lnd** — Landing: Raw data ingestion with minimal transformation
- **1_rhs** — Raw History: Incremental historization with merge logic
- **2_ehs** — Enterprise History Standardization: Schema harmonization across sources
- **3_int** — Integration: Business Concepts (BC) and Events (EV) models
- **4_dm** — Data Marts: Dimensional models for analytics
- **5_rm** — Reporting: Presentation layer with JSON payloads

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**: `git clone https://github.com/coolgradient/cg-de-assignment`
2. **Read the assignment**: Open `models/interview/ASSIGNMENT.md`
3. **Follow the step-by-step guide** to complete the assignment
4. **Submit your work**: Email your completed repo to rogier.werschkull@coolgradient.com
