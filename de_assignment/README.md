# CoolGradient Data Engineering Assignment

This repository contains hands-on dbt assignments for data engineering candidates. Choose the assignment that matches your role:

## Assignment Types

### 📊 Data Engineering (DE) Assignment
**Focus**: Building a multi-layered data warehouse pipeline from raw data to reporting layer.

**You will be tested on**:
- Implementing incremental data processing with merge logic and idempotency
- Building models across 6 warehouse layers (LND → RHS → EHS → INT → DM → RM)
- Making materialization decisions (table vs view, incremental vs full refresh)
- Handling late-arriving data with lookback windows
- Schema standardization and data harmonization across multiple sources
- Creating reusable macros for repeating patterns
- Dimensional modeling and aggregation strategies

**See**: `DE_ASSIGNMENT.md` for detailed requirements

### 🔍 Data Quality (DQ) Assignment
**Focus**: Designing and implementing a comprehensive data quality testing framework.

**You will be tested on**:
- Writing dbt schema tests (uniqueness, not-null, referential integrity)
- Creating custom data quality tests and macros for complex validations
- Detecting data anomalies (gaps, outliers, range violations, sensor failures)
- Writing analytical SQL to investigate quality issues
- Distinguishing legitimate data patterns from actual quality problems
- Designing a scalable DQ strategy across all warehouse layers
- Understanding DMBOK data quality dimensions (completeness, validity, accuracy, etc.)
- Proposing monitoring and alerting strategies

**See**: `DQ_ASSIGNMENT.md` for detailed requirements 

## What's Inside

This repo contains a **6-layer data architecture** that extends the medallion architecture:

- **0_lnd** — Landing: Raw data ingestion with minimal transformation
- **1_rhs** — Raw History: Incremental historization with merge logic
- **2_ehs** — Enterprise History Standardization: Schema harmonization across sources
- **3_int** — Integration: Business Concepts (BC) and Events (EV) models
- **4_dm** — Data Marts: Dimensional models for analytics
- **5_rm** — Reporting: Presentation layer with JSON payloads
